Data structures:
  * String -- A sequence of unicode characters
  * URLString -- A sequence of unicode characters segemented into the various
        components of a URL (scheme, user, password, host, port, path, query,
        and fragment).
  * ParsedURL -- A sequence of unicode characters segemented into the various
        parts of a URL (scheme, user, password, host, port, path, query, and
        fragment).  A ParsedURL differs from a URLString in that each component
        of the string (and the characters between the components) has been
        canonicalized.

Algorithms:
  * parse: String -> URLString
  * canonicalize: URLString -> ParsedURL
  * resolve: ParsedURL x String -> ParsedURL
